# Orbs are reusable packages of CircleCI configuration that you may share across projects, enabling you to create encapsulated, parameterized commands, jobs, and executors that can be used across multiple projects.
# See: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/orb-intro/
orbs:
  # The python orb contains a set of prepackaged CircleCI configuration you can use repeatedly in your configuration files
  # Orb commands and jobs help you with common scripting around a language/tool
  # so you dont have to copy and paste it everywhere.
  # See the orb documentation here: https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/python
  python: circleci/python@1.5.0

# Define a job to be invoked later in a workflow.
# See: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#jobs
jobs:
  build-and-test: # This is the name of the job, feel free to change it to better match what you're trying to do!
    # These next lines defines a Docker executors: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/executor-types/
    # You can specify an image from Dockerhub or use one of the convenience images from CircleCI's Developer Hub
    # A list of available CircleCI Docker convenience images are available here: https://circleci.com/developer/images/image/cimg/python
    # The executor is the environment in which the steps below will be executed - below will use a python 3.10.2 container
    # Change the version below to your required version of python
    docker:
      - image: circleci/python:3.8.1-buster
    # Checkout the code as the first step. This is a dedicated CircleCI step.
    # The python orb's install-packages step will install the dependencies from a Pipfile via Pipenv by default.
    # Here we're making sure we use just use the system-wide pip. By default it uses the project root's requirements.txt.
    # Then run your tests!
    # CircleCI will report the results back to your VCS provider.
